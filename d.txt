For this problem, we first do a recursive CTE to find all subtopics
 branching from 'Support'

After recursively finding all the subtopics, we then join the newly created table
 with discussions to merge the tid's together and gain access to the messages

Once merged, we unnest all the messages we then filter messages using regex
 operation: WHERE msg ~* '(refund|return)'. This then will give us all the rows
 in which the discussion comes from a subtopic from the parent topic, 'Support',
 as well as all messages that match this regex expression.
