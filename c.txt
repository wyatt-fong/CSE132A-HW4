For this problem, we first joined the two tables off of 'pid'.

After joining the two tables, we then unnest the comments associated with the
 product. This breaks the comment array into individual rows
 so that I can check each comment separately.

Now that all the comments are unnested, we can check whether the category of
 a product is 'electronics' and also check if the comments section contains
 potential substrings that indicate something is broken

Once we query off these conditions, we are only left with the product(s) with issues
 and a description of their issues.
