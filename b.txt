For this problem, we first selected all outgoing links that start from 'home'.
This forms the initial set of reachable pages.

After that, we use a recursive CTE to keep following each target page as long
as it appears as a source somewhere else in the table. This lets us walk the
entire graph until no more pages can be reached.

Once we have every reachable page, we filter the results using the regex
condition ~* '(ref|polic)' to keep only the pages whose names contain
those substrings.

After applying this filter, we are left with the pages reachable from 'home'
that match the keyword requirements.
